# <p align="center">She's A Scientist</p>

<p align="center">An homage to my late grandmother and to all women scientists, she's a scientist is a web application built to feature and highlight the careers of just a few of the many women scientists whose work has shaped technology, medicine and life as we know it, and who broke down countless barriers for women as a whole. Designed to resemble the world reknowned science journal, nature, she's a scientist users are shown a randomly featured woman scientist on the first page. Users can subsequently click on a link to learn more about the featured scientist, or navigate to a dashboard of many women scientists, with a quick highlight on their work and their respective fields. Users can filter the scientists by field, or search for specific scientist by keyword, or name. Additionally, users can click on a specific scientists' image to be taken to a page with additional information on their life and work, and a link to visit their wikipedia.</p>
